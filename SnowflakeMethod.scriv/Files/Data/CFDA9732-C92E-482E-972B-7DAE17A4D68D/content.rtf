\par\plain {\f2\fs24\b0 Good fiction doesn't just happen, it is designed. You can do the design work before or after you write your novel. I've done it both ways and I've found that doing it first is quicker and leads to a better result for me. But you may find that doing your design after you write your novel works better for you. It doesn't really matter when you do your design work, as long as you do it. Design is hard work, so it's important to find a guiding principle early on. This software uses a powerful metaphor to guide your design.}
