Write a one-sentence summary of your story.

The point here is to be short, precise, and find a sentence that encapsulates your story idea in one short sentence.

It is the sentence that you can always come back to and everything that you write from this point on should be a fulfillment of the idea that is represented by this one sentence core idea.
